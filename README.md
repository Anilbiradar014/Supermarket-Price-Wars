# Supermarket-Price-Wars
The objective of the investigation is to figure out which supermarket, Coles or Woolworths, is cheaper. The sample is gathered from the website https://grocerycop.com.au/products which includes 9 products from each of the 10 categories. A large sample of 90 (n > 30) is chosen in accordance with Central Limit Theorem(CLT) to effectively avoid the issue with normality and to limit standard error. We have used Stratified Sampling method to randomly select the products from each category(i.e, strata). The dataset consists of 6 variables - Sl_No, Product_Name, Units, Category, Coles_Price, and Woolworths_Price. The Product_Name, Units and Category match between Coles and Woolworths. All the product prices are in Australian Dollars (AUD). The summary statistics and Box plot help in comparing the prices between the stores. The QQ-Plot of Diff column(Coles_Price - Woolworths_Price) is used for exploring the Normality. The paired-samples t-test is used to check for the statistically significant mean difference between Coles and Woolworths prices. The result of the dependent sample t-test signifies that there is a statistically significant mean difference between Coles Price and Woolworths Price. In conclusion, Woolworths prices are found to be significantly cheaper when compared to Coles prices.
